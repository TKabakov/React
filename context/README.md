These are exercises that I make for practicing context in React. I added some useMemo examples.

The sources of the exercises are:
https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context
https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext

Challege 1: Replace prop drilling with context (ImageContext.js)
Example 1: Updating a value via context (ThemeContext.js)
Example 2. Updating an object via context (UpdatingObjects.js)
Example 3:
Skipping recalculation with useMemo
